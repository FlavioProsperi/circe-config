# Contributing

As part of the [circe] community, circe-config supports the [Typelevel] [code of
conduct] and wants all of its channels (Gitter, GitHub, etc.) to be welcoming
environments for everyone.

Bugs and feature requests should be reported in the [GitHub issue tracker] and
answer the following questions:

 - Motivation: Why should this issue be addressed? What is the purpose?
 - Input: How can the bug be reproduced? What are the pre-conditions?
 - Output: What is the expected outcome after the issue has been addressed?

For bugs also include the circe-config, circe and Scala version you are using.

Please read the [circe Contributor's Guide] for information about how to submit
a pull request.

This circe community module is currently maintained by [Jonas Fonseca], with
guidance from [Travis Brown]. It strives to conform as closely as possible to
the style of circe itself.
